        This is a just a taste of the properties you can use to customize the Flexbox grid. As I
        mentioned previously, I just wanted to give you a quick introduction to using Flexbox and
        some of the terminology that is needed. Let's take what we've learned and build on that by
        building a Flexbox grid in Bootstrap.
    </div>
    <div class="child3">
        Whether your are using Flexbox or not, the grid is based on Bootstrap's regular row and
        column classes. If you are familiar with the Bootstrap grid, this will work exactly as you
        expect it to. Before you start any Bootstrap project, you need to decide if you want to use a
        Flexbox or regular grid. Unfortunately, you can't use both at the same time in a Bootstrap
        project. Since the focus of this chapter is on Flexbox, we'll be using the appropriate grid
        configuration. By default Bootstrap is set up to use the regular grid. Therefore, we are going
        to need to edit the source files to activate the Flexbox grid. Let's start by downloading the
        source files again from h t t p : / / v 4 - a l p h a . g e t b o o t s t r a p . c o m / .
        Once you've downloaded the ZIP file, expand it and rename it so you don't get confused.
        Call it something like Flexbox Bootstrap . Next we'll need to edit a file and recompile the
        source files to apply the changes.
